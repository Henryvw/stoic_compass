          %h3 Why do I need a free account?
        %p You can access the Doctrines and Quotations pages without an account. The reason that individual accounts are needed is because when you practice a Stoic Exercise in the Exercises section, you will enter into dialogue with yourself about personal experiences from an ancient Stoic philosophical perspective. You should have the choice to keep these thoughts private. An account enables you to do that.
